Welcome to my GitHub Pages!
Here you'll find info on my publicly available software related: events, presentations, projects and more of mine.
If you're interested in how I made this website, its history, or offering edits, please see [this site's online git repository](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/louis-langholtz.github.io).

Other related web sites and activites:
- I'm the organizer of the [New Mexico C++ Programmers Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers). If you're interested in C++, especially if you live in New Mexico, please [join us](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/join/)! You don't have to live in New Mexico however - so far our events have been online and open to anybody interested in C++.
