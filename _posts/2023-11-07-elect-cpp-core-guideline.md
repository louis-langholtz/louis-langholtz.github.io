On this year's U.S. elections day, the [New Mexico C++ Programmers Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/) held its **Elect Your Favorite C++ Core Guideline!** meetup [event](https://www.meetup.com/new-mexico-cpp-programmers/events/297028223/).
This was a fun and lighthearted event I hosted for teaching each other about the C++ Core Guidelines and sharing our perspectives on them.

I nominated **[I.4](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-typed): Make interfaces precisely and strongly typed**.
Some other guidelines were nominated and discussed.
Like, **I.13: Do not pass an array as a single pointer**, and **Per.6: Don’t make claims about performance without measurements**.
I have to say, I'm very fond of both of those as well.

Meetup group member and assistant organizer, Cliff Green, showed us a YouTube video [A load of bool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gV7jhTMYkKc).
In it, Björn Fahller, at C++ on Sea 2023, does a presentation with examples of problematic code and examples of more strongly typed code that addresses those issues.
Thank you Björn!

In the end, I abstained from voting and the votes unanimously came in favor still for I.4.
So, there you have it!
This year's elected C++ Core Guideline for the NM C++ Programmers, was I.4!

If you're not already a member of the New Mexico C++ Programmers Meetup Group, but you're interested in C++ even if you're not in New Mexico, join the group!
Joining is free and possibly fun!
