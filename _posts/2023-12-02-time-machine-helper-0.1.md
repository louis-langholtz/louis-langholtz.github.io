I'm excited to announce that I have tagged the latest commit of my [Time Machine Helper](https://github.com/louis-langholtz/time-machine-helper) project's source code with its inaugural `v0.1` git tag, creating this apps first "release" (as GitHub calls these)!

If you're also a user of macOS Time Machine and don't mind dealing with source code, please check the application out and let me know what you think.

Looking to the future:
- I'd like to make binaries available for macOS Sonoma or put the application up on Apple's App store. I'm waiting at least till GitHub makes a Sonoma runner available however so I can use their continuous integration services to help with that.
- Also, the application's path-based actions are admittedly clunkier than I'd prefer. I have some ideas for improving that which as time allows I'd also like to get to.
